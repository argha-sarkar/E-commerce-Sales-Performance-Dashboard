E-commerce Sales Performance Dashboard is a critical component of any e-commerce or financial services business. With this dashboard, I can track a lot of things, like how much profit in any month, whose amount is the highest, category-wise how much percentage quantity is stored, etc. 

With the help of this project, we learn many things -
* Engineered an interactive dashboard for dynamic tracking and in-depth analysis of online sales data.
* Implemented intricate parameters, utilizing advanced filters and slicers for detailed worksheet drill-downs.
* Established robust connections, integrated new tables, and executed tailored data manipulations, empowering user-driven parameterization for diverse visualizations.
* Crafted a visually rich landscape employing customized charts (bar, pie, clustered bar, line) and dynamic slicers.
